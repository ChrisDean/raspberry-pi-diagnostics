# raspberry-pi-diagnostics
This a script to run hardware diagnostics against most models of raspberry pi (I've not checked all features across 
the board but happy to take feedback.

It was written due to a need to batch test a set of about 200 raspberry pis with no quick and easy non-commercial 
option to do so.

It should just run and work. If it doesn't do feel free to submit a bug report and then attempt to fix it and submit 
a PR for your fix.

Usage:
clone this repo and run
```
python ./run.py
```
